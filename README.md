# Vanilla Javascript Essentials
This Repository is a collection of Vanilla Javascript Essentials. 
For the most part, I followed an awesome youtube tutorial series called "[Dream Coding By Ellie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcsVjmHrUQg&list=PLv2d7VI9OotTVOL4QmPfvJWPJvkmv6h-2)". 
The materials were very helpful to brush up my skills and to pick up new syntax that I was not familar with.

Notes and examples are written by me, while being inspired by, at times, clone-coding the referenced tutorial and other great resources from online. 
Oh, I'm a huge Conan O'brien fan, so some examples were written with Conan as a theme.
