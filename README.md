# Vanilla Javascript Essentials

This Repository is a collection of Vanilla Javascript Essentials.
For most part, I followed an awesome youtube tutorial series called "[Dream Coding By Ellie](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_4u-bXaba7yrRz_6x6kb_w)".
The materials were super helpful to brush up my skills and to pick up new syntax that I was not familar with.

Notes and examples are written by me, while being inspired by, at times clone-coding the reference tutorials and other great resources from online.
